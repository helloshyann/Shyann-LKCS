## Objective
Implement the home page design for the fictional bank, LKCS Financial.

## Considerations
### Initial Implementation with Bootstrap 5

Upon first recieving the home page design, I drew out the various sections, rows, and columns to help me better envision 
how to initially carve out the HTML. Bootstrap 5 operates with a grid system, which I knew would help me organize elements to create 
a clean and responsive page. I also leveraged Bootstrap 5 for the purpose of building a responsive navbar that could be toggled by a 
hamburger icon while viewing the website on smaller devices like phones.

### Diagonal Design

Making the diagonal design was by far the most interesting challenge. After doing some research and messing around with the new things I learned, 
I recreated the effect by using CSS to create psudo-elements, transforming them by skewing them along the y-axis to get that parallelogram shape, 
and then clip-path the edges of those elements to give the illusion the sections are actually slanted. While this solution worked, it caused a few 
finicky margin/padding type issues where there was more space between elements than desired.
