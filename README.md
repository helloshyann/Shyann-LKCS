## Objective
Implement the home page design for the fictional bank, LKCS Financial.

## Considerations
### Initial Implementation with Bootstrap 5

Upon first recieving the home page design, I drew out the various sections, rows, and columns to help me better envision 
how to initially carve out the HTML. Bootstrap 5 operates with a grid system, which I knew would help me organizeelements to create 
a clean and responsive page. I also leveraged Bootstrap 5 for the purpose of building a responsive navbar that could be toggled by a 
hamburger icon while viewing the website on smaller devices like phones.
